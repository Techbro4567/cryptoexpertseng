           <p>Big fan of CryptoExperts - right from the initial engagement, Chris really took time to patiently explain every step to me, was reassuring and very committed. I felt very comfortable that this was in their hands. They did manage to crack my password for me which was great! Very impressive.
            Would highly recommend to anyone who like me, could not quite remember what they had used.</p>

        <p>These people are amazing and extremely professional! I contacted them when I lost the login to my wallet. Thinking it was a lost cause, I didn’t have much to lose. They were incredibly kind and helpful. I sent them the information I had and my best password guesses. It took a while because I didn’t have complete information. Sure enough, they were able to give me access to my wallet! It’s scary to trust someone on the internet with
             you password and account information but these people are trustworthy and professional</p>

            <p>I had a more complicated problem recovering my Bitcoin from an 
                old wallet that I forgot about for many years. The CryptoExpert 
                Team stuck with me the whole time until they came up with a solution that worked and I now 
                have my BTC back when I really thought it would be lost forever! This team has the ability to crack
                 passwords and they are completely trust worthy in handing back your funds once they have recovered your BTC! No one has anything to worry about! Nothing to lose, only to gain!</p>

            <p>Couldn't be happier with the service: prompt, transparent and super friendly!
            Thought I lost my 24-word phrase and after 3 years of trying to figure it out myself and 
            already giving up on my crypto assets I heard about these guys and after a very professional approach
             (2 e-mails, zoom meeting and voila) and a few days waiting I got my crypto back!
              I could not be more thankful to Chris and Co. for his/their help! HIGHLY recommended!</p>
